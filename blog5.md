The team will be taking the Agile Approach to the Methodology that'll be used in Development. The Agile Approach focuses on the idea of iterative progress. Agile Approach requires in-depth planning and look closely at how things are implemented and completed before moving onto the next step. Once the team finishes the tasks at hand, the team will test the software to ensure it's consistency before moving on to the next "sprint". This is to ensure redundency in the software and prevent possible hiccups in bug testing in the future or potentially leaving a fatal flaw in development. The agile apporach is standing within most software development firms and many different companies modify this approach to their companies liking to make it flexible according to their needs and schedule.
