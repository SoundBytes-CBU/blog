# Week of 9/28/20

This week, the team set out to complete the following tasks:

- Complete Midterm Presentation Packet
- Update and Restructure SRS 2.1 - 2.4
- Client Feedback & Final Script Review
- Meeting with Jeff Prosise
- Describe Methodology that will be Used (SRS 3.1)
- Application Methodology (SRS 3.2)
- Communication Mechanisms (SRS 3.3)

## Client Feedback & Final Script Review

The team submitted the Client Feedback & Final Script Review on September 22, 2020 and are awaiting and response from the Client.

## Meeting with Jeff Prosise

The team met with Jeff and discussed general approaches to machine learning implementations. They also discussed the different projects that have used different machine learning implementations throughout the last 5 years in the industry and its significance. Jeff mentioned a project where machine learning was used to detect if illegal activities were being conducted such as chopping down trees within the Amazon rainforest. Finally, Jeff mentioned a seminar he'd like to have going over the general aspects of Artificial Intelligence and its subsets.

## Preparing for Midterm Presentation

The team worked throughout the week to prepare the Midterm Presentation that is to be discussed and show on 10/5/20 during EGR401, Section H.

## Describe Methodoloy (SRS 3.1)

![Team Discussing/Meeting](https://github.com/SoundBytes-CBU/blog/blob/gh-pages/images/week5/team_meeting2.png?raw=true)

The team will be taking the Agile Approach to the Methodology that'll be used in Development. The Agile Approach focuses on the idea of iterative progress. Agile Approach requires in-depth planning and look closely at how things are implemented and completed before moving onto the next step. Once the team finishes the tasks at hand, the team will test the software to ensure it's consistency before moving on to the next "sprint". This is to ensure redundency in the software and prevent possible hiccups in bug testing in the future or potentially leaving a fatal flaw in development. The agile apporach is standing within most software development firms and many different companies modify this approach to their companies liking to make it flexible according to their needs and schedule.

## Application Methodoloy (SRS 3.2)

The team has discussed and will be implementing a variation of the Agile method for this teams specific software development methodology. The team will take a slight deviation from the Agile method as we will have two different sub teams that will be working on two different sets of tasks for each sprint, one-week period of time. During each sprint the team will meet, plan, and discuss the plan for each sprint. Once the team as agreed on the plan of attack for that specific sprint the team will divide into sub team where the sub teams will come up with measurable goals that will be entered into the log-sheet. One sub team will specifically be working on implementation, while the other is doing research specific to the implementation of the next sprint. While one team is implementing the project, the other will be updating the research paper with their implementation specific findings. The teams will then switch what they are working on in the next sprint. The key idea of this approach is so that we can iteratively work on the web application aspect of our project while also simultaneously keeping the research paper concurrent and updated.

## Communication Mechanisms (SRS 3.3)

### Internal Communication Mechanisms
The team intends to communication on different platforms based on the situation. Each member intends to communicate via Cell Phone through an iMessage Group Chat. The team also intends to use their Discord Server with specific channels to easy organize messages between the group. The team intends to share documents and report other tasks to the channel and follow up via iMessage.

### External Communcation Mechanisms
The team intends to communicate to the outside client and any vendors through email and zoom. The team intends to relay documents through email primarily and respond quickly and accurately to any questions prompted by the client or vendor. Zoom is intended to allow for Face to Face communication during the COVID-19 Outbreak.
