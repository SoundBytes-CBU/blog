These tasks were completed successfully throughout the period the week.

## Project Proposal
The project proposal was editing from the original report sent in for approval on 8/28/20. The propsal was updated on 8/31/20 and submitted on 9/2/20. The original proposal was to work with AI/ML to determine if a individual is lying, creating a fully automated polygraph test. After consideration from the client, it was suggested that the project would be too complex for the aloted time frame assigned for the course. Therefore, the proposal was udated to identify bottlenecks and other issues in current AI/ML systems and algorithms. This is to produce a solution that will allow indiviudals to determine the speed at which certain algorithms perform given a task at hand, specifically, running a model that identifies annomilies while driving a vehicle on a public roadway or interstate.

## Creating the Blog
The blog, which you are reading, was created on 9/1/20 and was updated to begin starting with Week 2 of EGR401. This blog was created on Github and is hosted using Github pages. This Github repo used to host these files can be found [here](https://github.com/SoundBytes-CBU/blog)

## Updating the Blog for Week 2
The blog was updated to support this blog entry for the week of 8/31/20 through 9/6/20.
