## Project Overview
The entire purpose of the project is to identify bottlenecks within various machine learning algorithms and then producing a solution that will increase the speed that these algorithms are able to produce results. In order to accomplish our goal, we will be comparing the algorithms to each other while they are running a model that identifies anomalies while driving a vehicle on a public roadway.
