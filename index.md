## Project Overview
The entire purpose of the project is to identify bottlenecks within various machine learning algorithms and then producing a solution that will increase the speed that these algorithms are able to produce results. In order to accomplish our goal, we will be comparing the algorithms to each other while they are running a model that identifies anomalies while driving a vehicle on a public roadway.

## Purpose & Need
The real-world issue that is going to be approached is diagnosing the status of current AI/ML algorithms and identifying any bottlenecks within those algorithms. One of the most prevalent problems in the world of AI/ML algorithms, specifically relating to autonomous vehicles, is the speed at which the AI/ML model can produce results when given and input. The model is simply not fast enough to offer sufficient reactions in case of a dangerous abnormality. In order to ensure the safety of the passenger or passengers in the autonomous vehicle, the algorithms in which the current AI/Ml models are based on must be overhauled in a way that offers a significant decrease in runtime. Analyzing the top algorithms and dissecting details are essential for the continuation and development of autonomous vehicles.

## Business Drivers & Significance
Business drivers for this instrument will attract investors in the autonomous vehicle industry because it will aid with the research of which algorithms are best for detecting certain sounds by associating them as anomalies within an isolated system. Additional drivers are to improve the accuracy of the current algorithms in the market. 

## Benefits & Cost
Beneficiaries would have an AI model that is capable of differing various non-specific sounds and obtain the source solely on sound. The machine would be equipped with the fastest out of five hand-picked algorithms. The cost would be a computer to run the AI model.
