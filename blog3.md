# Week of 9/14/20

This week, the team set out to complete the following tasks

- Analyze the alogrithms found and extrapolate a high-level overview
- Research how ML algorithms are being used completitively in industry
- Identifiy and Discuss Project Implementation tools
- Completeing Final Demonstration Script

## Algorithm Research
The team this week worked to look at different common algorithms used for these kind of scenarios that require Machine Learning in sound. The team researched multiple different ways that have been used to handle such anomolies when it comes to programming for sound recognition. Market research was completed to determine different competitiors within the market and to see which algorithms were derived from others when it comes to recongition of anomolies. The team discovered their are 5 different levels of autonomous vehicles. Level 5 being considered a self-driving car with no human input required. 

## Identifying and Discuss Project Implementation tools

The team also took time to determine what tools would be required to complete the work expected in the upcoming months. While no definitive answers were made, as the team determined that changes might be required on the fly, given the complex schedules of each individual participant. The team determined mainly the test environment and how this would work.

The test environment would be set up in both a controlled and not controlled environment. Controlled being a room where sounds of the road are mimicked and a computer is listening to determine the direction and anomoly which occurs. This environment can be easily manipulated and doesn't required much setup, and would be the basis for check to see if any code or parts of the project implementation are working before moving it into a real environment.

The not controlled environment, does not required a autonomous vehicle. In this environment, we intend to drive around the area with the tools developed to determine if anomolies are picked up while drive along common public roads and interstates in the local area.

## Completeing Final Demonstration Script
The team also worked to complete the demonstration script that would be used as part of the initial proposal or SRS. This was submitted to the client on 9/20/20.
