# Week of 9/21/20 - 9/27/20 (Week 5)

This week, the team set out to complete the following tasks:

- Summarize Final Problem Understanding (SRS 2.1)
- Analyze one or two plausible solutions (SRS 2.2)
- Select a preferred solution and Discuss (SRS 2.3)
- Describe Solution Abstractions (SRS 2.4)
- Send Deliverables to Jeff Prosise

## Problem Understanding (SRS 2.1)

![Analysis of Deep Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/SoundBytes-CBU/blog/blob/gh-pages/images/week5/problemUnderstanding.png?raw=true)

The team set out to determine the main problem and the goals that are required to solve the problem and determine the fastest algorithm based on the ones that are commonly used. Based on the commonly used algorithms determine the accuracy based on anomalies presented to the system and quickly and effeciently act in such a way to prevent a collison or other accident. With information collection the question proposed: "What would be a methodical and plausible system consisting efficient processes that accurately analyzes these machine learning algorithms."

## Identifying Solutions (SRS 2.2)

The team identified two potential solutions to testing the questions at hand...

Published research using Top-Down research strategy with Raspberry Pi Drag Race Demonstration. This runs a set of algorithms on Rasperry Pi and determines whichever "race car" has completed the task the quickest. This would provide the opportunity for a level-playing field and equal opportunity across the board. 

Concurrent research strategy with a Web App Demonstration. Groupe splits into two individual teams and handles different areas of research. Implementation of Python and RESTful services testing Machine Learning Algorithms using Linear Regression Model and Neural Network Model, and determine the speed and efficency at which these are completed. 

## Preferred Solution (SRS 2.3)

The team intends to create a Hybrid Testing Approach using both a Web App & Raspberry Pi "Drag Race" to complete a set of machine learning algorithms, determining which one is most efficient and fastest when it comes to detecting anomolies. The intent is to conduct research and report the findings in a paper. Research Method would be mainly "Top-Down" focused where each member would research different studies done on Machine Learning when it comes to detection of anomolies while driving and then developing a proof-of-concept web application that users may run to determine the results of the proposed problem at hand. 

## Describing Solution Abstractions (SRS 2.4)

Top down research will be completed on Artifical Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. From there the team will work to develop a comprehensive analysis of potential algorithms can be used to solve the problem. The team then intends to test these algorithms using a Web Application and a Raspberry Pi "Drag Race" to determine speed and efficency.
