# Week of 9/7/20

This week, the team set out to complete the following tasks

- Updating the Weekly Log Sheet for Week 3.
- Interview client to specific the project needs.
- Develop the Initial Problem Statement.
- Create questions to ask the client.
- Summarize information from the client interview.
- Research & Analysis on Algroithms.
- Updating the Blog for Week 3

##Client Interview & Summary

On Friday, September 11, 2020 around 5pm, members of the team, specifically Rigoberto & Jacob met with Professor L. Clement, the client, to discuss the goals for the project and what is expected by the client & the CBU College of Engineering at the completion of the project.

This project, which can be found [here](project.md), focuses on the effeciency and the comparison of algorithms when given a particular challenge or task. In this project, the task is to detect and determine anomalies that can be detected on a public roadway or interstate based on the sounds. This can be, but not limited too: Screeching Tires, Emergency Vehicle Sirens, Children/Pedestrians, etc.

The goal is to determine these anomalies quickly and effeciently. To do this, we intend to compare the same sounds and anomalies to multiple different AI/ML algorithms, and determine the how fast these systems are able to detect and respond to the anomaly and compare how they work with each specific anomaly.

##Initial Problem Statement

The team worked together throughout the week to create a Initial Problem Statement that we understand to be submitted with the SRS (Software Requirements Specification). The problem statement as given by the client: "A recent article in Wired magazine highlighted the computing demands of current AI and ML algorithms is so great that progress on tasks such as translation and autonomous vehicles is likely to slow."

The Initial Problem Statement was added to the SRS and submitted on 9/13/2020.
